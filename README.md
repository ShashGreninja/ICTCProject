# Project Sharing and Contribution Platform

The problem statement involves creating a platform where professors, research groups and senior students can create projects for which they require assistance; and students can contribute in them whilst making sure they develop their own portfolio and skills.

The platform will be targeted for 4 types of people :
1. Students - These can be the contributors (1st year and above)
2. Mentors - These are senior "students". They have the additional functionality of creating their own projects. (3rd year and above)
3. Professors and Research Groups - These will not contribute, but will create their own projects for contributions.
4. Admin - A user with superior powers who oversees the integrity of the platform, performs occasional plag checks, and maintains decorum.
